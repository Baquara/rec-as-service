  abstract  = {Nowadays, software developers often utilize existing third party libraries and make use of Application Programming Interface (API) to develop a software. However, it is not always obvious which library to use or whether the chosen library will play well with other libraries in the system. Furthermore, developers need to spend some time to understand the API to the point that they can freely use the API methods and putting the right parameters inside them. In this work, I plan to automatically recommend relevant APIs to developers. This API recommendation can be divided into multiple stages. First, we can recommend relevant libraries provided a given task to complete. Second, we can recommend relevant API methods that developer can use to program the required task. Third, we can recommend correct parameters for a given method according to its context. Last but not least, we can recommend how different API methods can be combined to achieve a given task. In effort to realize this API recommendation system, I have published two related papers. The first one deals with recommending additional relevant API libraries given known useful API libraries for the target program. This system can achieve recall rate@5 of 0.852 and recall rate@10 of 0.894 in recommending additional relevant libraries. The second one deals with recommending relevant API methods a given target API and a textual description of the task. This system can achieve recall-rate@5 of 0.690 and recall-rate@10 of 0.779. The results for both system indicate that the systems are useful and capable in recommending the right API/library reasonably well. Currently, I am working on another system which can recommend web APIs (i.e., libraries) given a description of the task. I am also working on a system that recommends correct parameters given an API method. In the future, I also plan to realize API composition recommendation for the given task.},

Arguing that these problems result from in- adequate documentation and shortcomings in the design and implementation of the APIs, the goal of this research is to develop and evaluate two developers' issues elimination tools (DIETs) for mobile API developers to diminish the problems of mobile applications (apps) development.After categorizing the problems, we investigate their causes, by exploring the relationships between the topics and trends of posts on Stack Overflow, the app developers' experience, the API and test code, and its changes. The results of these studies will be used to develop two DIETs that support API developers to improve the documentation, design, and implementation of their APIs.},

  abstract  = {Recommendation systems are intended to assist users in dealing with information overload by providing a content filtering mechanism. Content filtering is based on the user's preferences and interests. Current recommendation systems suffer from the problem of a lack of initial information about new users. This problem, known as the cold-start problem, is present both in existing systems and in new systems, in which any user is a new user. In addition, web application developers find it difficult to integrate recommendation systems into their applications, having to resort to third-party software or develop the recommendation system from scratch. In this work, URecommender is proposed, an API for web recommendation systems composed of a Middleware and a Framework capable of identifying the textual content of greatest interest to the user and recommending relevant related content. Such identification is done implicitly and based on the user's current behavior, which can solve the cold-start problem. In addition, URecommender gives the developer greater control over the recommendation system that will be integrated into the web application under development. The API was used for the development of a real web application and demonstrated good results in the recommendations generated.},

So to make the Cloud services commercialized, Cloud markets are necessary and are being developed. As the increasing numbers of various Cloud services are rapidly evolving in the Cloud market, how to select the best and optimal services will be a great challenge. In this paper we present a Cloud service selection framework in the Cloud market that uses a recommender system (RS) which helps a user to select the best services from different Cloud providers (CP) that matches user requirements. The RS recommends a service based on the network QoS and Virtual Machine (VM) platform factors of difference CPs. The experimental results show that our Cloud service recommender system (CSRS) can effectively recommend a good combination of Cloud services to consumers.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, as the Internet spreads, the use of the Web Service has increased, and it has diversified. The Web Service is registered with UDDI, and the user selects service there and can use it for the provider by making a demand. In future, if the Web Service comes to be used more widely, the number of Web Services will increase, and the number of registrations at the UDDI will also increase. The user examines the large number of available services, and needs to choose the service that best matches their purpose. Quality of Service (QoS) is used as an index when a user chooses a service. Many studies show that the scoring of QoS for service selection is important. Quality of Service is registered by the provider and is treated as an objective factor. However, subjective evaluation, the evaluation of the user after the service use, is also needed to choose the best service. In this study, we use a new element, evaluation, in addition to QoS for service selection. We have expanded the existing filtering technique to make a new way of recommending services. Our method incorporates subjective evaluation. With this model, we apply the technique of information filtering to the Web Service recommendation and make an agent. Also, we simulate it after having clarified the behavior and tested it. The results of testing show that the model provides high levels of precision.},

  abstract  = {The growing ecosystem of Web APIs and IoT devices enables us to create a mashup within a short period of time. However, it is difficult to find appropriate Web APIs and IoT devices. Moreover, investigating a combination of Web APIs and IoT devices is much more difficult. The growing ecosystem enables us to achieve ideas in alternative ways, although it is difficult to find such alternative ways. We propose a recommendation system that takes the quality characteristics and such alternative ways into account. The system is implemented using a Steiner tree approximation algorithm, which can recommend a combination of Web APIs and IoT devices suitable for mashups. We tested the system in two aspects, i.e., the validity and performance of the algorithm. The validity was proved by running the system against a graph of actual Web APIs and IoT devices. The performance was proved by running the system against large graphs generated using a pseudorandom number generator. The system can output a result within 8 s against 28,200 nodes and five terminals, which is a considerably shorter time than that required by skilled developers to come up with a combination.},

This problem is being tackled by Job Recommendation systems. But not every aspect from the wide spectrum of factors is incorporated in the existing systems. For the "Job Recommendation System - Vitae" machine learning and data mining techniques were applied to a RESTful Web Server application that bridges the gap between the Frontend (Android Application) and the Backend (MongoDB instance) using APIs. The data communicated through APIs is fed into the database and the Recommendation System uses that data to synthesize the results. To make the existing systems even more reliable, here efforts have been done to come up with the idea of a system that uses a wide variety of factors and is not only a one-way recommendation system.},

Thus, led up to overload information problem, which is making APIs selection more and more difficult for devices owners and users. Therefore, this paper propose web APIs recommendation framework in IoT environment based on social relationships. The main purpose is providing a novel Recommendation method, which enable to discover APIs and provide relevant suggestion for users. The proposed hybrid algorithm is combined content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to improve the accuracy of rating prediction.

The recommender system is deployed over a real-time big data architecture designed to work with Apache Hadoop ecosystem, thus supporting horizontal scalability, and is able to provide recommendations as a service by means of a RESTful API. The performance of the recommender is measured, resulting in the system being able to provide dozens of recommendations in few milliseconds in a single-node cluster setup.},
