We study the problem of learning such a non-discriminatory predictor from a finite training set, both statistically and computationally.  We show that a post-hoc correction approach, as suggested by Hardt et al, can be highly suboptimal, present a nearly-optimal statistical procedure, argue that the associated computational problem is intractable, and suggest a second moment relaxation of the non-discrimination definition for which learning is tractable.}

Once the integration to such a service is done, the e-commerce retailer still wish to have some control on the service.

In this demo we provide an overview of a real backend system which enables to a typical website owner exactly these capabilities.

  abstract  = {In recent years, as the Internet spreads, the use of the Web Service has increased, and it has diversified. The Web Service is registered with UDDI, and the user selects service there and can use it for the provider by making a demand. In future, if the Web Service comes to be used more widely, the number of Web Services will increase, and the number of registrations at the UDDI will also increase. The user examines the large number of available services, and needs to choose the service that best matches their purpose. Quality of Service (QoS) is used as an index when a user chooses a service. Many studies show that the scoring of QoS for service selection is important. Quality of Service is registered by the provider and is treated as an objective factor. However, subjective evaluation, the evaluation of the user after the service use, is also needed to choose the best service. In this study, we use a new element, evaluation, in addition to QoS for service selection. We have expanded the existing filtering technique to make a new way of recommending services. Our method incorporates subjective evaluation. With this model, we apply the technique of information filtering to the Web Service recommendation and make an agent. Also, we simulate it after having clarified the behavior and tested it. The results of testing show that the model provides high levels of precision.},

So to make the Cloud services commercialized, Cloud markets are necessary and are being developed. As the increasing numbers of various Cloud services are rapidly evolving in the Cloud market, how to select the best and optimal services will be a great challenge. In this paper we present a Cloud service selection framework in the Cloud market that uses a recommender system (RS) which helps a user to select the best services from different Cloud providers (CP) that matches user requirements. The RS recommends a service based on the network QoS and Virtual Machine (VM) platform factors of difference CPs. The experimental results show that our Cloud service recommender system (CSRS) can effectively recommend a good combination of Cloud services to consumers.},

  abstract  = {Recommendation systems are intended to assist users in dealing with information overload by providing a content filtering mechanism. Content filtering is based on the user's preferences and interests. Current recommendation systems suffer from the problem of a lack of initial information about new users. This problem, known as the cold-start problem, is present both in existing systems and in new systems, in which any user is a new user. In addition, web application developers find it difficult to integrate recommendation systems into their applications, having to resort to third-party software or develop the recommendation system from scratch. In this work, URecommender is proposed, an API for web recommendation systems composed of a Middleware and a Framework capable of identifying the textual content of greatest interest to the user and recommending relevant related content. Such identification is done implicitly and based on the user's current behavior, which can solve the cold-start problem. In addition, URecommender gives the developer greater control over the recommendation system that will be integrated into the web application under development. The API was used for the development of a real web application and demonstrated good results in the recommendations generated.},

Thus, led up to overload information problem, which is making APIs selection more and more difficult for devices owners and users. Therefore, this paper propose web APIs recommendation framework in IoT environment based on social relationships. The main purpose is providing a novel Recommendation method, which enable to discover APIs and provide relevant suggestion for users. The proposed hybrid algorithm is combined content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to improve the accuracy of rating prediction.

This problem is being tackled by Job Recommendation systems. But not every aspect from the wide spectrum of factors is incorporated in the existing systems. For the "Job Recommendation System - Vitae" machine learning and data mining techniques were applied to a RESTful Web Server application that bridges the gap between the Frontend (Android Application) and the Backend (MongoDB instance) using APIs. The data communicated through APIs is fed into the database and the Recommendation System uses that data to synthesize the results. To make the existing systems even more reliable, here efforts have been done to come up with the idea of a system that uses a wide variety of factors and is not only a one-way recommendation system.},
